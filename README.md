# Minikube and Kubernetes Lab Setup

This guide walks you through setting up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube and kubectl. It includes step-by-step instructions with screenshots to help you visualize each step.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Minikube**: Minikube runs a local Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine (VM).
2. **Install kubectl**: kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Minikube and kubectl

First, make sure you have Minikube and kubectl installed.

- **For Minikube**:
  - **Linux**: `curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64`
  - **macOS**: `brew install minikube`
  - **Windows**: Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install minikube`)

- **For kubectl**:
  - **Linux/macOS**: `curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"`
  - **Windows**: Download [kubectl for Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)

### Step 2: Start Minikube

Start a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

```bash
minikube start
```

This will initialize a local Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine.

### Step 3: Verify Cluster

To verify that the Minikube cluster is running, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

This should display a node with a `Ready` status, showing that your local cluster is up.


### Step 4: Create a Deployment

Now, letâ€™s create a simple Kubernetes deployment using a container image. For example, you can deploy a simple nginx web server.

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This command tells Kubernetes to create a deployment named `nginx`, using the official nginx image.

*

### Step 5: Expose the Deployment

Next, you need to expose your deployment to make it accessible. You can expose it through a service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80
```

This will expose the `nginx` deployment via a `NodePort`, which is accessible on a port in the range 30000-32767.

**Screenshot Placeholder**: *Insert screenshot of the `kubectl expose deployment` command output here.*

### Step 6: Get the URL for Access

After exposing the deployment, you need to get the URL to access the service. Minikube provides an easy way to access it:

```bash
minikube service nginx --url
```

This will provide a URL, like `http://192.168.99.100:30001`, that you can use to access your nginx web server.

**Screenshot Placeholder**: *Insert screenshot of the `minikube service nginx --url` command output here.*

### Step 7: Check Running Pods

You can check the status of the pods running in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see the pod for `nginx` listed with a `Running` status.

**Screenshot Placeholder**: *Insert screenshot of the `kubectl get pods` command output here.*

### Step 8: Scale the Deployment

You can scale your deployment to increase or decrease the number of replicas (pods) running.

For example, to scale to 3 replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
```

*
To verify the scaling, check the pods again:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```


### Step 9: Deleting the Deployment

When you're done and want to clean up, you can delete the deployment and service:

```bash
kubectl delete service nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
```



## Example of Working Kubernetes Command Flow

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start

# Verify Minikube and Kubernetes cluster status
kubectl get nodes

# Create a deployment for nginx
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

# Expose the nginx deployment
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80

# Get the URL of the exposed service
minikube service nginx --url

# Check the status of running pods
kubectl get pods

# Scale the nginx deployment to 3 replicas
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3

# Clean up (delete service and deployment)
kubectl delete service nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
```

## Conclusion

By using Minikube and kubectl on your local laptop, you can easily create, manage, and scale Kubernetes deployments. Minikube is an excellent tool for setting up a local cluster to test and experiment with Kubernetes before deploying to a production environment.
